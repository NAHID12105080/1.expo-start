# expo-start

## Overview

`expo-start` is the first app I built to practice the basics of React Native and Expo. It serves as a learning project to get hands-on experience with creating mobile applications using Expo's powerful toolset and libraries. The app focuses on core React Native concepts, UI design, navigation, and working with assets.

## Key Features

- **React Native Basics**: Focus on learning fundamental concepts such as components, styling, and state management.
- **Expo Setup**: Configuration and setup of the Expo environment to create and run React Native apps with ease.
- **Assets**: Utilization of images, icons, and other assets in the app.
- **UI Practice**: Designing and styling basic user interfaces with components such as `View`, `Text`, `Image`, and `Button`.
- **Navigation**: Understanding navigation patterns for mobile apps (you can add details if using navigation libraries like React Navigation).
